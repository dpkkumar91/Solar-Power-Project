<b># Solar-Power-Project</b>
## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze solar power generation data and corresponding weather data from two solar plants, Plant 1 and Plant 2. The primary goals are to understand the impact of weather conditions on solar power generation, identify seasonal variations in energy production, and assess the effectiveness of operational practices in maximizing energy output. This analysis will provide valuable insights into the performance, efficiency, and resilience of solar energy systems, contributing to the advancement of renewable energy technologies.

## Objectives

1. **Understand the Impact of Weather Conditions on Solar Power Generation:**
   - Analyze how various weather factors (such as ambient temperature, module temperature, and irradiation) influence the power generation of the solar plants.

2. **Identify Seasonal Variations in Energy Production:**
   - Investigate how energy production varies across different seasons and weather conditions.

3. **Assess the Effectiveness of Operational Practices:**
   - Evaluate the current operational practices by comparing actual performance against potential performance and identifying areas for improvement.

## Scope of Work

### ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

1. **Extract:**
   - Load data from the provided CSV files:
     - `Plant_1_Generation_Data.csv`
     - `Plant_2_Generation_Data.csv`
     - `Plant_1_Weather_Sensor_Data.csv`
     - `Plant_2_Weather_Sensor_Data.csv`

2. **Transform:**
   - Parse the `DATE_TIME` column into a datetime format.
   - Handle missing values and ensure data type consistency.
   - Merge generation data with corresponding weather data for both plants based on the `DATE_TIME` and `SOURCE_KEY` columns.

3. **Load:**
   - Store the cleaned and transformed data into suitable data structures (e.g., DataFrames) for analysis.

### EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

1. **Descriptive Statistics:**
   - Compute summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for power generation and weather variables.

2. **Visualization:**
   - Plot time series of power generation and weather variables.
   - Create scatter plots to analyze the relationship between weather conditions (temperature, irradiation) and power generation.
   - Use histograms and box plots to examine the distribution and variability of the data.

3. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Assess the correlation between weather variables and power generation to understand their impact.

4. **Seasonal Analysis:**
   - Identify and analyze seasonal patterns in power generation and weather data.

## Methodology

The project follows a structured approach to perform ETL and EDA, leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The data is first extracted from CSV files and then transformed to ensure consistency and cleanliness. Various statistical and visualization techniques are employed to analyze the data and derive meaningful insights.

## Key Findings

1. **Impact of Weather Conditions:**
   - The analysis revealed significant correlations between weather variables and solar power generation, highlighting the influence of ambient temperature, module temperature, and irradiation on energy output.

2. **Seasonal Variations:**
   - Seasonal patterns in energy production were identified, with variations observed across different months. These findings underscore the importance of considering seasonal factors in solar energy management.

3. **Operational Effectiveness:**
   - By comparing actual performance against potential performance, areas for improvement in operational practices were identified, suggesting strategies to enhance energy efficiency and output.

## Personal Reflection

This project stems from my interest in renewable energy and data analysis. Through this analysis, I aimed to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, demonstrating how data-driven insights can drive improvements in solar energy systems. The findings from this project not only contribute to the understanding of solar power generation but also emphasize the potential of data analytics in advancing renewable energy technologies.
